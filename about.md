Hello, I'm GetFreeCash. I'm a moderator of /r/movies on reddit, a site on which I waste far too much time.

In my real life I'm a 20-something IT professional from Canada. I like to do things like watch James Bond movies, fiddle around with Android devices and my Raspberry Pi, and buy expensive lipsticks with absurd-sounding shade names in my spare time. I also like to travel but like most people who haven't reached retirement age I'm finding it difficult to find the money and time to do that on a regular basis.

If you want to contact me, please send me a message on reddit. Just put /u/GetFreeCash into the 'compose message' form.
