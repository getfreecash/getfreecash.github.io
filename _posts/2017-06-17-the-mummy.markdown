I may have been too hard on [*Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales*](https://getfreecash.github.io/movies/2017/05/29/potc-5.html) when I reviewed it, fresh out of the cinema, in a fit of rage a couple of weeks ago. It was pretty bad and I did find the attempts to carbon-copy Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley's characters from the first three films to be quite pathetic, but at least that film didn't flat-out insult my intelligence like *The Mummy* did. Supposedly this film now holds the honour of being Tom Cruise's most successful international opening weekend ever, but I attribute that to the film opening simultaneously in many foreign territories (which is rare, usually international releases are staggered between countries) and not to the quality of the film itself, because this film does nothing that you haven't seen another film (in some cases, *another Tom Cruise film*) do better and in many respects it completely fails at doing anything well.

Chief among its many problems is the fact that this movie is still operating under the impression that Tom Cruise is irresistible, both to women (even the undead ones!) and to moviegoing audiences. We'll discuss the chick magnet thing later because it's problematic as fuck and deserves its own paragraph - but if we've learned anything from the past few Mission: Impossible films and from recent films like *Edge of Tomorrow* for which Cruise has been praised, it's that on his own he is not necessarily the key to a good film these days. Surround Tom Cruise with good characters and a story that took longer than twenty minutes to write, and you probably have something good in the works, but he cannot shoulder the burden alone. Plenty of people have said (and will continue to say) that they will watch movies for Cruise's performance alone, and obviously he is still a box office draw, but unfortunately Cruise doesn't make movies like *Magnolia* or *Collateral* anymore and the kinds of movies he does make these days need more than his bizarrely youthful countenance to be above average or even competent.
