1. Lipstick or lip gloss?

If you had asked me this question 10 years ago, it would be unequivocally lip gloss (I was such a lame teenager), but now the answer is always gonna be lipstick. I can't leave the house without my lipstick.

2. How often do you wear a bra?

Always, if I'm anywhere besides my house. At home, I don't wear one.

3. How moody are you when you are on the your period?

Not moody at all, although a few days before my period starts I might feel a little more emotional than usual. It's hard to articulate, I don't feel sad or anything, I just feel like a nice cathartic cry might be called for on those days. Otherwise it doesn't affect me at all.

4. Skirts or dresses?

Dresses.

5. Are your ears pierced?

No, not a huge fan of body modification.

6. Do you like high heels?

Yes, very much so, but I almost never have an opportunity to wear them these days.

7. Have you ever worn high heels casually?

No. The de facto dress code of the Pacific Northwest is incredibly casual so wearing high heels during the day in places that don't call for them draws so much attention.

8. Have you ever been a bridesmaid?

No, I've never even been to a wedding before.

9. How often do you think about your wedding?

I almost never think about it. But then again, I don't plan on having one anytime soon (if ever).

10. Have you ever been a Girl Scout?

No.

11. Have you ever been a homecoming or prom queen?

No to both. Not that there's any bitterness in either respect, especially since the prom queen when I was a senior was this lovely girl who had been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis that year, so she 100% deserved something lovely like that.

12. Do you belong to a sorority?

No, but many of my friends do.

13. What is the heaviest you have ever weighed?

I don't think I've ever gone over 150 pounds? I honestly am not sure.

US Size 4

16. Do you like the color pink?

I don't feel any particular way towards it.

I have actually thought about this on several occasions, but never in a terribly serious way - it's usually the result of me having some hobbies or interests which are traditionally considered more masculine, and sometimes I just feel like it would be easier to find like-minded people if I was a guy. But it's nothing compared to actual feelings of gender dysphoria, and I don't want to trivialize people who do actually have to endure feelings like that with what I'm saying here.
