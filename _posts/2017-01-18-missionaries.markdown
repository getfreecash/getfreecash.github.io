These Mormon missionaries are getting craftier, let me tell ya.

I was riding the subway back home from a Craigslist transaction (I sold a book to this guy outside a casino for $10, it was great) and on the penultimate stop to my destination, this girl got on the subway and said to me that she liked my jacket. I didn't hear her at first because I was listening to the [director's commentary for *Terminator 2: Judgment Day*](http://thedirectorscommentary.tumblr.com/archive) (which I highly recommend, incidentally) and was not paying attention to my surroundings.

In retrospect that opener should have been my first tip-off that I was about to be subjected to a two-minute elevator pitch for the Latter-Day Saints because my jacket [looks like this](http://www.aritzia.com/en/product/avoriaz-parka/15123.html?dwvar_15123_color=2819) and pretty much every woman in the Pacific Northwest owns a parka like this in basically the same shade of green. You can't go shopping in my city without stumbling upon one.

In any case she then asked me where I bought it, and I named the store - and then (damn my kindness) I helpfully added there was a branch of said store in a mall that was two stops away. Unfortunately I hadn't realized this girl was a fuckin' Mormon missionary yet, I and as luck would have it the mall I mentioned is literally **ACROSS THE STREET** from Vancouver's largest Church of Latter-Day Saints. I'm not making that up, I literally set myself up for a segway. I could literally feel my face fall when she said "Oh, my church is right next to that mall!".

What happened between then and when I made a speedy exit for the doors (thankfully, my stop was the next one) was me making up some bullshit answers about what I was studying in university and the location of my immediate family. She did give me a business card with a link to the Mormons' lovely live chat website before I basically bolted off the subway and threw it in the nearest garbage can.

I guess the lesson here is don't talk to random strangers on the bus, especially if they initiate the conversation, because you will get Jesus Christ - and die.
