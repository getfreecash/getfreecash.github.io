My track record with television is spotty at best. I have a real problem trying to keep up with TV shows, which is part of the reason why I've never watched really popular series like *Game of Thrones* - because at this point there are just far too many episodes for me to catch up on. Shows like *Sherlock* which only release a thimbleful of episodes every 2 - 3 years are perfect for the attention span-challenged like me... but more on that tomorrow.

Most recently I did manage to finish the first (and thus far only) season of *Westworld* on time, so in the interest of keeping up my streak I watched the pilot of BBC's new series ***Taboo*** tonight shortly after its premiere. It stars - among others - Tom Hardy, Oona Chaplin, and the always delightful Jonathan Pryce.

Honestly, I'm liking what I've seen so far. I had been feeling some trepidation as some of the reviews I'd read a few days ago had been less than stellar, and I sat through five episodes of ITV's *Victoria* last year solely for Jenna Coleman before deciding I couldn't handle murdering my brain any further, but this proved not to be your average period drama.

Its aesthetic definitely owes more to *Sweeney Todd* rather than Jane Austen novels, as much of the pilot takes place in the seedy backalleys and backrooms of London circa 1814. Prostitutes pop up frequently, including one played by Franka Potente who I was really happy to see acting in things (English-language things, rather) again. I personally can't stand the traditional 'corset-ripping' soap operas that one normally thinks of when talking about British period dramas, so I was quite pleased upon realizing that *Taboo* leans towards the natural and grit-filled aesthetic of, say, *The Revenant*.
